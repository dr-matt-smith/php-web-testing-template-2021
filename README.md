# php-web-testing-template-2021
template project, using Codeception, just add UNIT and ACCEPTANCE tests, and the code to pass the tests...

How to use:
1. Download this project
2. at the CLI run: `vendor install`
3. copy tests classes into `/tests/unit` and `/tests/acceptances`
4. run the webserver in the background
5. TDD life cycle: (a) run tests and see what fails (b) write code to pass failing tests


You'll probably need to create (and populate) the following diretories to pass the tests:
 - `/src`
 - `/public`
 - `/templates`
